#### ROM (Rough Order of Magnitude)
[Rough Order of Magnitude](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-a-rom-price-and-cost-estimate-2)
```
Lower Bound = ROM Estimate x 0.75
Upper Bound = ROM Estimate x 1.75

Sample: 
Ticket cost 6$
Popcorn cost $4
For two person in a date would cost a total of 20$

15$ = 20 x .75   - lower boundary of estimated total cost
35$ = 20 x 1.75  - upper boundary of estimated total cost

15$ to 35$       - Thinking if you go on a date you could expect to spend as much 30$
